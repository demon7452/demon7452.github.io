## 一、Google VR SDK for Android

The Google VR SDK for Android supports both Daydream and Cardboard, including a simple API used for creating apps inserted into Cardboard viewers, and the more complex API for supporting Daydream-ready phones and the Daydream controller.

The Google VR NDK for Android provides a C/C++ API for developers writing native code.

Developers familiar with OpenGL can quickly start creating VR applications using the Google VR SDK, simplifying common VR development tasks such as:
	- Lens distortion correction.
	- Spatial audio.
	- Head tracking.
	- 3D calibration.
	- Side-by-side rendering.
	- Stereo geometry configuration.
	- User input event handling.
	
We're keeping the hardware and software open to encourage community participation and compatibility with VR content available elsewhere.
